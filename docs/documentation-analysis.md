## Identified Overlaps

### Technical Documentation Overlaps
1. System Architecture Information
   - architecture-v2.md ↔ system-analysis-v2.md
   - Overlap in system components and infrastructure design
   - Recommendation: Merge architectural content into architecture-v2.md, keep analysis in system-analysis-v2.md

2. Security Implementation
   - security-v2.md ↔ payment-system-v2.md ↔ credit-system-v2.md
   - Duplicate security measures and requirements
   - Recommendation: Centralize security in security-v2.md, reference from other documents

3. Performance Requirements
   - Multiple documents contain similar performance metrics
   - Recommendation: Centralize in monitoring-v2.md, reference from other documents

4. Error Handling
   - error-handling-v2.md ↔ payment-system-v2.md ↔ credit-system-v2.md
   - Duplicate error handling strategies
   - Recommendation: Centralize in error-handling-v2.md

### Business Documentation Overlaps
1. Pricing Information
   - marketing-plan-v2.md ↔ ukraine-pricing-strategy-v2.md
   - Duplicate pricing structures and packages
   - Recommendation: Move core pricing to marketing-plan-v2.md, keep region-specific in ukraine-pricing-strategy-v2.md

2. Market Analysis
   - marketing-plan-v2.md ↔ ukraine-pricing-strategy-v2.md
   - Overlapping market analysis sections
   - Recommendation: Separate global vs regional analysis

## Consolidation Strategy

### Phase 1: Technical Documentation
1. Architecture Consolidation
   - Move all system component definitions to architecture-v2.md
   - Keep analysis and strategy in system-analysis-v2.md
   - Update cross-references

2. Security Centralization
   - Move all security implementations to security-v2.md
   - Create clear security guidelines
   - Reference from other documents

3. Performance Metrics
   - Centralize in monitoring-v2.md
   - Create standardized metrics
   - Update all references

4. Error Handling
   - Consolidate in error-handling-v2.md
   - Create error type hierarchy
   - Standardize error handling patterns

### Phase 2: Business Documentation
1. Pricing Structure
   - Create unified pricing model in marketing-plan-v2.md
   - Keep region-specific adjustments separate
   - Ensure consistent terminology

2. Market Analysis
   - Separate global and regional analysis
   - Remove duplicated content
   - Maintain clear relationships

### Phase 3: Integration
1. Cross-Reference Updates
   - Update all document references
   - Ensure proper linking
   - Maintain document relationships

2. Content Verification
   - Verify no information loss
   - Validate all links
   - Update glossary terms

## Implementation Plan

### Immediate Actions
1. Create consolidated security documentation
2. Centralize performance metrics
3. Unify pricing structure
4. Update cross-references

### Secondary Actions
1. Merge architectural content
2. Standardize error handling
3. Separate market analyses
4. Update related documents

### Final Actions
1. Verify all content preserved
2. Update navigation structure
3. Review document relationships
4. Final consistency check

# Security System

## Document Information
- **Last Updated:** 2025-02-08
- **Version:** 1.0.0
- **Status:** Draft
- **Owner:** Security Team

## Overview
The Security System implements comprehensive security measures, protocols, and best practices across the Tarot Reading Bot platform. It ensures data protection, user privacy, and system integrity through multiple layers of security controls.

## Background
Security is fundamental to our system's operation, particularly given the handling of User Profile data, payment information, and Reading History. Our security implementation adheres to industry standards including GDPR and PCI DSS, while providing robust protection against various security threats.

## Detailed Content

### Authentication & Authorization

#### API Authentication
- JWT-based authentication
- 24-hour token expiry
- Rate limiting implementation
- User status verification
```python
TOKEN_EXPIRY = 24 * 60 * 60  # 24 hours
```

#### User Authentication
1. Bot (Telegram) OAuth Integration
   - Secure OAuth flow implementation
   - State parameter validation
   - CSRF protection
   - Callback URL validation

2. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
   - Optional 2FA enablement
   - Time-based OTP (TOTP)
   - Backup codes provision
   - Device remembering capability

3. Session Management
   - Secure Session handling
   - Automatic Session expiry
   - Concurrent Session limits
   - Security event invalidation

### Data Protection

#### Personal Information Security
1. User Profile Protection
   - Field-level encryption
   - Access control implementation
   - Data validation
   - Access logging
   - GDPR compliance

2. Reading History Protection
   - Encrypted storage
   - Access controls
   - Retention policies
   - Data anonymization
   - Secure backups

3. Payment Information Security
   - No direct card storage
   - PCI DSS compliance
   - Payment tokenization
   - Secure gateway integration
   - Transaction encryption

#### Encryption Implementation

1. Transit Security
   - TLS 1.3 implementation
   - Strong cipher suites:
     * TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
     * TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256
   - 2048-bit certificates
   - HSTS configuration

2. Data at Rest Security
   - AES-GCM encryption
   - Key rotation
   - Secure key management
   - Encryption context tracking
   - Nonce management

### System Security

#### Infrastructure Protection
1. Network Security
   - Firewall configuration
   - DDoS protection
   - VPN access control
   - Network monitoring
   - Traffic encryption
   - Port security

2. Server Security
   - Regular updates
   - Hardened configurations
   - Access logging
   - Intrusion detection
   - Resource isolation
   - Secure boot process

3. Database Security
   - Access control
   - Query parameterization
   - Connection encryption
   - Audit logging
   - Backup encryption
   - Data masking

### Security Monitoring

#### Event Monitoring
- Authentication events
- Access control events
- Encryption operations
- Network activity
- System resources
- User behavior

#### Alert Thresholds
1. Authentication Alerts
   - >5 failed attempts/minute
   - New IP access
   - Unusual patterns
   - Session anomalies

2. Access Control Alerts
   - Unauthorized attempts
   - Permission violations
   - Resource access patterns
   - Rate limit breaches

### Incident Response

#### Response Protocol
1. Detection Phase
   - Automated monitoring
   - Manual reporting
   - User notifications
   - System alerts
   - Anomaly detection

2. Assessment Phase
   - Impact evaluation
   - Scope determination
   - Risk assessment
   - Response prioritization
   - User impact analysis

3. Containment Phase
   - Threat isolation
   - System protection
   - Evidence preservation
   - Service continuity
   - User notification

4. Recovery Phase
   - System restoration
   - Data verification
   - Service resumption
   - Post-incident review
   - Security enhancement

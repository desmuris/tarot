# Git Setup Plan

## 1. Verify Git Installation
- Check if git is installed and accessible from command line
- If not installed, provide instructions for installation

## 2. Initialize Git Repository
- Initialize new git repository in the current directory
- This will create a .git directory to track changes

## 3. Git Configuration
- Set up user name and email for commits
- These are required for making commits

## 4. Create .gitignore
- Create a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files
- Include common patterns for:
  - Operating system files (e.g., .DS_Store, Thumbs.db)
  - Editor files (e.g., .vscode)
  - Temporary files
  - Log files

## 5. Initial Commit
- Add existing files to git tracking
- Create initial commit with message "Initial commit"

## Next Steps
After approving this plan, we'll switch to Code mode to implement these steps. The Code mode has the necessary permissions and tools to execute git commands and create/modify files.
